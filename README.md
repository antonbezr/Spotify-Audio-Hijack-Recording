# Spotify QuickTime Player Recording

This AppleScript script allows the user to record/download songs from Spotify on any Mac OS device using QuickTime Player.

Dependencies for this script:
* Soundflower - https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower
* switchaudio-osx - https://github.com/deweller/switchaudio-osx

Before starting script:
* Make sure Spotify is playing from album/playlist you wish to download.

The script is able to capture audio quality in MP3 320 kbps (CBR) as can be seen in the spectral below. This is the highest audio quality for MP3 files. MP3 320kbps (CBR) has a frequency cut-off at 20.5 kHz which is consistent with the spectral.
