# Spotify Audio Hijack Recording

This AppleScript script allows the user to record/download songs from Spotify on any Mac OS device. An additional application (Audio Hijack Pro v.2) is needed in order to utilize this script. The script is able to capture audio quality in 320 kbps as can be seen in the spectograph screenshot below.
